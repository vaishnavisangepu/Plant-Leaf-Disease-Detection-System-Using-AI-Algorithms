# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-System-Using-AI-Algorithms
A Plant Leaf Disease Detection System using AI algorithms is designed to identify and classify plant diseases from images of leaves. This system employs machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze leaf images, detect abnormalities, and diagnose potential diseases. Typically, it involves collecting a large dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize patterns associated with different diseases, and then deploying this model to predict the health status of leaves in real-time. Such systems can significantly aid farmers in early disease detection, leading to timely interventions and better crop management.
